# Kalman_filter

For my project, we utilized the Kalman filter in conjunction with the Hungarian algorithm to track multiple moving objects in three videos. The Kalman filter provided state estimation for each object, while the Hungarian algorithm efficiently associated the detected objects with the predicted states, enabling accurate and robust tracking across the videos. This approach allowed us to achieve reliable and real-time multiple object tracking in our project.
